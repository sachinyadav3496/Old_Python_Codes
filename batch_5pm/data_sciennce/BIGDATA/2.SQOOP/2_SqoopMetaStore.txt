BY default Sqoop Metastore Link HSQL(Memcache). We can check in sqoop-site.xml

Sqoop command in Oozie to connect with the jobs stored in metastore

sqoop \
job \
--meta-connect \
"jdbc:hsqldb:file:/on/server/not/hdfs/sqoop-metastore/sqoop-meta.db;shutdown=true" \
--create \
jobName \
-- \
import \
--connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@server:port:sid \
--username username \
--password-file /path/on/hdfs/server.password \
--table TABLE \
--incremental append \
--check-column ID \
--last-value "0" \
--target-dir /path/on/hdfs/TABLES

Some Open questions:
1) Sqoop Metastore:

a)  Where , why & how we configure Sqoop Metastore?b)  Whats the use of Sqoop Metastore in real time?c)  Default Metastore of Sqoop & how we can change Sqoop Metastore? (HSQL is the default one & its a MemCache means Memory Database)d)  Sqoop Merge commande)  Sqoop REST APISf)   How & why we create Sqoop jobs & whats the use-case?g)  How sqoop get to know from which record next job need to import data into  HDFS.(whether updated or appended)>>>>>Answer is Sqoop Metastore (Implement why & how)
Sol: Go inside conf dir & open sqoop-site.xml (Metstore is defined & there we change it it any SQL database) 

h)  To test default metastore of Sqoop >>>>>>sqoop metastore
jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://metaserver.example.com:16000/sqoop

2) Oozie Bundle Jobs :: If we want to execute mutiple co-ordinator jobs dependent on each other or want to run same job parallelely then we create Bundle jobs.PFB attached code & screenshot for further clarification(Bundle Jobs)>>>(Go through the code & find the root file for the project).


a)  How to call Oozie workflow from shell script? >>(https://hadoopjournal.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/call-oozie-workflow-from-shell-script/)b)  Writing shell script for each & every workflow(Hive,Sqoop,Mapreduce)
c)  How Oozie connect with Sqoop metastore to run jobs stored in Sqoop metastore.
Note : 1) Sqoop Metastore & Sqoop job using Oozie inter-connected 

2) Oozie connect to Sqoop using Sqoop Metastore  & run jobs stored in it(We will change metadata to MySQL so that multiple users (oozie or other external systems) can execute or access sqoop job at the same time)
